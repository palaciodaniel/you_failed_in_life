# You Failed in Life
A small game written as a Bash script, which means that you can directly play it on your Linux's Terminal!

It was done for demonstrative purposes, to showcase my current knowledge of Bash scripting. 

You can check the gameplay [here](https://youtu.be/V3dUqM3gDJ0) --choose the HD option if it is not enabled by default.

**DISCLAIMER:** Although running the program is pretty simple, if you are just a regular user, you should be careful when using the Linux Terminal. Also, if you are a programmer or an advanced user, it is strongly recommended to inspect the code before executing it, just to double-check. The program does not affect any other files in the system, but it momentarily alters the Terminal's format until it is closed. 

Also, the mini-game was only tested on **Linux Mint 19.2 Tina (64 bit)** so far. Loading the code into an online Bash shell will not work due to the formatting features.

## Instructions

Once you are ready, simply download the zip file into any directory you would like and extract it there. Enter the file's Properties and give it Permissions to run as a program (tick on the corresponding box). 

Finally, open right there the Terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and write "bash failedlife.sh".

You can see all these steps performed on the [following video](https://youtu.be/83cLVp8BcF4) --choose the HD option if it is not enabled by default.
