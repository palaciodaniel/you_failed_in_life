# You Failed in Life
A small game written as a Bash script, which means that you can directly play it on your Linux's Terminal!

It was done for demonstrative purposes, to showcase my current knowledge of Bash scripting. Consider it was only tested on **Linux Mint 19.2 Tina (64 bit)**.

## Instructions

Simply download the failedlife.sh file into any directory you would like. Enter that directory and right click on the file, enter its Properties and give it Permissions to run as a program (tick on the corresponding box). 

Once you're ready, open right there the Terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and write "bash failedlife.sh".
